# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Definition
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's a creational pattern that encapsulates a group of individual factories that have a common theme.

## Problem it Solves
- Need to create families of related products without depending on their concrete classes
- System should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
- Need to provide a library of products and reveal only their interfaces, not implementations
- Different product families need to be used together and this constraint needs to be enforced

## Key Components
1. **Abstract Factory**: Interface declaring creation methods for abstract products
2. **Concrete Factory**: Implements creation methods for specific product families
3. **Abstract Product**: Interface for a type of product object
4. **Concrete Product**: Specific implementation of abstract product
5. **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes

## Implementation Example
Our demo shows a cross-platform UI component system:
- **Factories**: WindowsFactory, MacFactory, LinuxFactory
- **Products**: Button, Checkbox, TextField for each platform
- **Client**: Application class using factory interface

## When to Use
✅ System should be independent of product creation  
✅ System needs to work with multiple families of products  
✅ Family of related products should be used together  
✅ Need to provide product library without exposing implementation  
✅ Lifetime of family is well-defined  

## When NOT to Use
❌ Only one product family exists  
❌ Products don't form families  
❌ Simple factory pattern would suffice  
❌ Products are not related or dependent  

## Real-World Examples
- GUI frameworks (Windows, Mac, Linux themes)
- Database drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Document formats (PDF, Word, HTML)
- Game engines (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP services)

## Advantages
✅ **Consistency**: Ensures products from same family work together  
✅ **Isolation**: Isolates concrete classes from client  
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to exchange product families  
✅ **Encapsulation**: Groups related product creation  

## Disadvantages
❌ **Complexity**: More complex than simple factory  
❌ **Extension**: Hard to add new product types  
❌ **Code Growth**: More classes and interfaces  

## Related Patterns
- **Factory Method**: Abstract Factory often implemented using Factory Methods
- **Singleton**: Factory classes are often Singletons
- **Prototype**: Products can be created using Prototype pattern

## Recognition in Code
Look for these indicators:
```java
// Multiple factory interfaces/classes
interface UIFactory { ... }
class WindowsFactory implements UIFactory { ... }
class MacFactory implements UIFactory { ... }

// Family of related products
interface Button { ... }
interface Checkbox { ... }
class WindowsButton implements Button { ... }
class WindowsCheckbox implements Checkbox { ... }

// Client uses factory to create related products
UIFactory factory = getFactory();
Button button = factory.createButton();
Checkbox checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
```

## Best Practices
1. **Use when products must work together**
2. **Keep factory interface simple**
3. **Consider using Singleton for factories**
4. **Use configuration to select concrete factory**
5. **Document product family constraints**

## Testing Strategy
- Test each concrete factory independently
- Verify product family consistency
- Test factory selection logic
- Mock factories for unit testing
- Integration tests for complete families

## Common Mistakes
1. Using when simple factory would suffice
2. Not enforcing family constraints
3. Making factory interface too complex
4. Creating products that don't belong to same family
5. Not considering future product additions
